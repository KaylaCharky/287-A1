    <h1> My Website </h1>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    An easy way to manage a VP Finance position of an ECA association

    <div>
        <h3>Summary of features / Description </h3>
        <p>
            This past year, I was an member of the executive team of the Engineering Games Concordia Delegation as the Vice-President of Sponsorship. I loved being on the team to help the association because the Engineering Games is a phenomenal way for students to get involved in extracurricular activities and go above and beyond what they learn in school as Engineering students.
            <br>
            Engineering Games is a multidisciplinary competition hosted in the beginning of January every year. It involves student from all fields of engineering who compete in a number of different competitions such as academic, robotic and entrepreneurial competitions. To prepare for these competitions, Enggames hosts a number of different events such as Networking Events, Consulting competitions and robotics competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year, I have applied as the Vice-President of Finance. Having been a previous member of the team, I watched the current VP struggle all year to manage ECA refunds, cash box, budget of each project competition, requests for money refunds made by the members of the exec and so on.
            <br>
            I would like to make a web application that manages all the forms, scheduling, progress, budgets, ticket sales to events, bank accounts and funds that go into the year to be able to help me in my job as VP Finance. This documentation will allow for the continuity and easy of use for the next VP to take on the mandate.
